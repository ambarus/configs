# SSH multiplexing
# The first invocation of ssh my-host.blabla.com will open a connection that
# is reused by later invocations and shared using a socket at
# ~/.ssh/ctrl-SOME_BIG_HEXADECIMAL_NUMBER. See man 5 ssh_config for details.
#
# Using multiplexing may cause the ssh command to hang. In such case try running
# ssh -O stop my-host.blabla.com
